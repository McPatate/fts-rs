# Rust Full Text Search Engine

This project is mostly inspired by the book [Introduction to Information retrieval](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/).

Inspired by Lucene, RocksDB, LevelDB and all the other good things databases have seen recently (and not so recently too).

This project is based on my personal research and will evolve over time into hopefully a fully functional and usable search engine in the likes of Lucene.

At each new version I'll write an article on my discoveries and technical choices that drove implementation.

More on that on my [blog](https://luc-sydney-georges.medium.com/).
